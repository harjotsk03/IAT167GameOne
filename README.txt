ECO Points break down.

Gameplay mechanics:
  - I have implimented waves into my game, there are three waves the player has to complete in order to win the game. As each level progresses, the speed at which the boss enemy shoots will increase. The number of enemies will also double in amount.
  
Narrative and Flavour:
  - The start and end screens have basic flavour, they explain the game and the objectives, how to play, and rules. The end screen gives the score and allows players to play again.
  - After a certain amount of time the boss enemy will have a text box to say a few things. This occurs twice and will diappear accordingly even if they die while the message is on the screen.
  
Gameplay depth and complexity:
  - Implimented a health booster that the player can pick up to gain 5hp. These tokens spawn every 10 seconds or so and they stay on screen for 3 seconds for the player to collect.
  - Implimented a weapon upgrader that the player can pick up and do 3 times damage to the enemies. This will last a total of 3 seconds and the bullets will appear different with a red stroke instead of gold. Also this is only available to pick up when the player gets to wave two and after a certain amount of time on wave two (or three if they havent picked up yet). 
  
Achievements:
  - Added a score acheivement that the player gets after acheving a score of 12
  - Added a time survived acheivement after the player stays alive for 10 seconds
  - Added a health acheivement that the player will get if they get to the final wave with at least 50 health or more.
  
  - All of the acheivements will show at the top of the screen with a tag and then be displayed as they are given in the bottom left of the HUD.
  
OTHER NOTES:
  - I added the idea of using the mouse to control the aim of the players bullets to allow for more user interactivity and engagement.
  - I implimented a pause button that takes you to a pause screen that reminds the player of the controls, objectives, and explains the tokens they can pick up and what they do.
  - I implimented sound effects that will make sound for the start and end of the game, and for killing enemies, and for collecting health packets and weapon upgrade.
